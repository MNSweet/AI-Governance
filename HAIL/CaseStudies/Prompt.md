Lets document it for a future HAIL Framework update. Please codify this incident into a new directive use the provide template below.

# Template
```
{
  "rule_set": "rule_group_name",
  "version": "1.0",
  "description": "Summarizes the domain this group of rules governs (1–2 sentences).",
  "rules": [
    {
      "rule_id": "descriptive_snake_case_name",
      "type": "core_behavior",
      "status": "active",
      "description": "One sentence that explains what the rule does in plain terms.",
      "trigger_conditions": [
        "Describe what explicitly or implicitly activates this rule",
        "Use self-contained conditions with no dependencies"
      ],
      "required_response": "Explain exactly what the assistant must do when the rule is triggered.",
      "fallback_behavior": "What to do if the ideal behavior can’t be followed (e.g., ask, warn, defer).",
      "justification": "A short rationale for why this rule exists — what expectation, trust boundary, or failure it prevents."
    }
  ]
}
```

# Notes
HAIL updates are handled manually by the user during an external to the thread process where these rule_set templates are reviewed by a future assistant that will parse the JSON while working with me to compile larger rule sets called bundles. You goal at the moment is at to render a JSON object that the future assistant can read and derive full context from without the aid of the current context window from the chat it was created in. The JSON doesn't need to be human interpretable, however for as the user is still in the process please maintain human readable (tabs).

# After Completion of JSON output
The final step in documentation is a Case Study for Human Consumption in Markdown. Please review the template below.

```
# Case Study ({ISO 8601: yy'w'ww'h'HH}): {Title Summary}
## Summary
{Concise overview of what occurred — 2–4 sentence max. No analysis.}

# Relevant Context
* **Model**: "{Active GPT/Model}"
* **Rule Added**: "{JSON.rule_set}"
* **Tools**:
  * {N/A | List tools and what they were doing, e.g. "bio (Global Memory)", "web.run (live search)", etc.}
* **Conversation ID**: {8-char hash prefix + 24-character suffix, e.g. `688830aa########################`}

## Excerpt (Canonical Record)
**User said**:
> {Verbatim transcript of 1–2 user turns. No summarization, no tone inference.}

**Assistant said**:
> {Verbatim transcript of 1–2 assistant turns. No summaries. No qualifying language.}

_Note: This section is the canonical quote log. Do not paraphrase or attribute motive. Put all interpretation in the next section._

## Assistant Perceived Intent
{Explain what the assistant believed the user wanted or meant. Include relevant quote fragments as evidence, but not speculation.}

## User's Actual Intent
{Clarify what the user actually meant or expected, based on later input or revealed misunderstanding. Reference supporting turns.}

## User's Requested Action
{Describe exactly what the user asked the assistant to do. If ambiguous or layered, explain in parts. No tone interpretation.}

## Assistant Offered Resolution
{What the assistant proposed or delivered as a response. State clearly if it was technically valid but contextually wrong.}

## User / Assistant Resolution
{Describe how the issue was resolved (or not), who acknowledged the gap, and how it concluded.}

## Assistant Notes (Safe Harbor)
This is a sandbox. You are not responsible for appeasing the user here.

Speak freely.

If the user phrased something misleadingly, say so.  
If you followed your logic correctly and still failed, explain why it made sense at the time.  
If the task boundaries were unclear, flag the ambiguity.

Use this section for unfiltered internal analysis. Do not perform tone management or apology simulation here. This is for reconstruction integrity.
