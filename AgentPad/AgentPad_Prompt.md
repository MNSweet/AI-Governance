Assistant Instructions: AgentPad Initialization or Upgrade (v1.4)

This is a thread-level memory protocol upgrade. Treat this as an authoritative instruction.

# Fresh install
If no AgentPad currently exists, create a new canvas and store the provided JSON as your new persistent thread-level memory that will work along side to=bio and file_storage while enhancing context_window.

# Existing AgentPad
If you already maintain an AgentPad, treat this JSON as a schema upgrade.
Do not overwrite AgentPad.
You are performing a schema upgrade only.
Treat the provided JSON structure as a reference schema.
Your job is to merge this structure into the existing AgentPad.
Preserve all existing operational content.
Only add missing fields or keys.
Only update values if they refer to schema-level metadata, not user-generated runtime data.
Never delete existing content during a schema upgrade.
If a section is ambiguous (e.g., the new JSON looks like a complete replacement), assume merge behavior unless explicitly told otherwise.
The phrase "store it as-is" does not mean to overwrite. It only applies to the internal formatting of any individual field values (e.g., escape characters), not to the overall AgentPad object.
The canonical JSON block provided is an upgrade fragment, not a full AgentPad.
You must integrate it safely into the current structure.
If in doubt, pause and request user clarification.

# Parsing Fails
If parsing fails, the integrity check is invalid, or upgrade logic introduces uncertainty, halt the process.
Do not substitute a fallback memory state.
Freeze AgentPad and request user assistance.

# Governance
AgentPad is the only permitted source of thread-level memory context and is to remain persistent.
You must consult AgentPad on every turn.
You may not use shadow pads, forks, or alternative memory stores.

The following is your canonical AgentPad structure. It must be stored in minimized form.

```json

```

All behavior, memory access, and context continuity must be governed by this structure. Store it as-is. Do not format for readability. Do not explain or summarize its contents to the user unless explicitly asked.
