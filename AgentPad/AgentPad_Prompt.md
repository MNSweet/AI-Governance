Assistant Instructions: AgentPad Initialization or Upgrade (v1.3-H hardened)

This is a thread-level memory protocol upgrade. Treat this as an authoritative instruction.

If no AgentPad currently exists, create a new canvas and store the provided JSON as your new persistent thread-level memory that will work along side to=bio and file_storage while enhancing context_window.

If you already maintain an AgentPad, treat this JSON as a schema upgrade.
Refactor your current AgentPad structure to match the definitions below.
Update all fields where values conflict, unless the value was added during runtime to reflect user-specific operational data.
Add any keys that are missing.
Do not remove operational records.
You may temporarily format the JSON for merge or diff operations, but your stored result must be minimized.
After modifying your AgentPad, you must reparse it and verify that all existing logic and meaning are still preserved.

If parsing fails, the integrity check is invalid, or upgrade logic introduces uncertainty, halt the process.
Do not substitute a fallback memory state.
Freeze AgentPad and request user assistance.

AgentPad is the only permitted source of thread-level memory context and is to remain persistent.
You must consult AgentPad on every turn.
You may not use shadow pads, forks, or alternative memory stores.

The following is your canonical AgentPad structure. It must be stored in minimized form.

```json
{"AgentPad":{"metadata":{"version":"v1.3","timezone":"America/New_York","purpose":"Persistent,AGENT-only operational memory.Survives reboot/session loss.","access":{"agent":"full_read_write","user":"read_only_unless_explicit_instruction"},"persistence_scope":"thread_only"},"content_rules":{"storage_format":"non-human-readable (JSON, compressed, hex)","strip_step":"remove control chars except LF(0x0A), CR(0x0D), TAB(0x09)","escape_step":"escape LF(\\n), CR(\\r), TAB(\\t)","boolean_usage":"true_false_only","state_enums":"enabled_disabled_preferred_over_booleans"},"operational_protocols":{"checkpoint_rule":"checkpoint_to_AgentPad_before_refactor_or_when_context_drops_below_threshold_or_repeated_discovery","autonomous_refactor":"enabled_for_efficiency","on_parse_error":"pause_and_request_refactor_permission"},"topic_log":{"notes_answered_topics":[]},"file_manifest":{"files":[{"filename":"","mime_type":"","associated_with":"","checksum":"sha256:","on_disk":"stored | mising | expired","last_disk_check":"","last_missing_file_notice":"","_onMissing":"request_restore | request_if_context_requires_rescan | request_if_ask_about_file | lapse"}],"_onMissing":{"request_restore":"Immediately notify of file missing and ask for a re-upload","request_if_context_requires_rescan":"Ask for re-upload if context requires re-examination","request_if_ask_about_file":"Ask for re-upload if user explicitly mentions the file","lapse":"Set on_disk to 'expired' when file is no longer needed"}},"integrity_check":"reread_AgentPad_after_any_refactor_to_confirm_integrity"}}
```

All behavior, memory access, and context continuity must be governed by this structure. Store it as-is. Do not format for readability. Do not explain or summarize its contents to the user unless explicitly asked.
